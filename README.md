# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
in this project, we had to analyze a ride sharing company over 
three area
- urban
- suburban
- rural


## Results



Total Rides	Total Drivers	Total Fares	Average Fare per Ride	Average Fare per Driver
type					
Rural	125	78	4327.93	34.623440	55.486282
Suburban	625	490	19356.33	30.970128	39.502714
Urban	1625	2405	39854.38	24.525772	16.571468


a few observations 
the rural area is more expensise while there are relatively less drivers
even though revenue is way low in rural area


the opposite in urban area with lots of drivers and revenue but the average fare is low

This data makes sense because more density in urban areas, and rural has the scarcity factor therefore pay more for the fare
Suburban area is in between, 


## Summary

Our recommendation is to hire more drivers in rural are to bring more revenue because 
the number of rides are less than availabe drivers 
same for suburban 
reduce the drivers in urban area also
